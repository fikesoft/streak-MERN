Hi there , this  is a personal project that shows the user an quote for every day, the app checks the day and saves it in db.
Also there is a calendar that shows your streak the history of your streak of each month.
There is an admin panel with the login and password with the first user ( me ).
Link to web> https://quotes-front.onrender.com 
Also there is an middlewere for additional security. 

The github repo is able for deployment on render just clone and you can deploy
Info how to deploy on render
1) Make an web service with folder backend
2) After this make an web static for frontend and make sure to edit the corse policy for getting req and res form other origin. Check out server.js

Finally enter the frontend link and the app will work fine .

!NOTE! The request needs more time for sending the responde because the server onrender saves data.But after your first request will work fine. !NOTE!
